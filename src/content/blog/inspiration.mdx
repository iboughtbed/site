<h2 id="creativity" data-author="Sanzhar">Creativity</h2>

What is creativity, really? Is it some kind of mysterious force, an innate gift only a few possess, or is it something more subtle, more universal? We often talk about creativity like it's this grand, almost magical thing—something that flows from artists and visionaries as naturally as breath. But is it truly about talent and inspiration, or could it be more about struggle, persistence, and the willingness to embrace failure?

When we call someone creative, what are we actually recognizing? Is it their ability to see connections others don't, or is it just their comfort with the unknown? Creativity seems to blur the line between chaos and structure—how much of it is accidental, and how much is intentional? Maybe it's not about coming up with something new, but more about rearranging the familiar in ways that suddenly feel fresh. Could it be that creativity is less about invention and more about re-discovery?

And then there's the question of whether creativity has limits. Is there a finite pool of ideas, or is it boundless, like an ever-expanding universe? Does it live in moments of solitude, in the quiet spaces where the mind wanders, or does it thrive in collaboration, sparked by the energy of others?

Perhaps the real mystery isn't what creativity is, but why we feel so compelled to chase it, to define it, to grasp it when it often slips away just as we think we've found it.


## Inspiration

<p data-author="Rauno">The Vercel team and how they inspired me.</p>

Vercel has been a major source of inspiration for me to dive deeper into design and UI/UX.
The platform's focus on seamless developer experience and beautiful interfaces sparked a passion
for creating visually appealing and highly functional designs.
Developers like @raunofreiberg, @shadcn, and @emilkowalski_ have been instrumental in fueling this
interest. Their work, from sleek components to thoughtful interactions, has shown me the importance
of combining design and development to create intuitive user experiences.
It’s this blend of creativity and technicality that keeps me motivated to explore and innovate further.

Design has always been something I've experimented with, and one of the standout moments was
when I built a website for my magazine club. I went all out with some of the craziest designs—mixing bold layouts, unique animations, and non-conventional elements. The result
caught the attention of one of the best developers in the country, as well as mentors
at the nFactorial Incubator, who were genuinely amazed by what I put together.
It was a big moment for me, pushing my creativity while still learning the balance
between innovation and usability in web design.
