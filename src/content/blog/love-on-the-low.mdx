## Love everywhere I go

Love on the low, love everywhere I go.

I think what I lacked as a little kid was affection and love.
I wanna give what I lacked to people, to my family, to my friends, to my kids.
The lack of love and affection led to me being mentally unstable and I had mental health troubles.
I couldn't accept love, because I was scared of it.
I craved for it, but I couldn't accept it at all.
Feeling fine, waiting here to find the sign that I can understand.

## Never gave a damn, now don't give a fuck entirely

I used to get bullied, for being a weird kid. I was skinny too.
People often tried to offend me, though I acted like I didn't care about it.
In fact I did care about it, and it hurt me deep down.
I think it was just a coping mechanism, being a little kid and feeling uncomfortable in my own body.

Slowly, I started to get more mature, realized that people are often not self-aware.
We should be loving, caring, not hating. I could've used some support.
People are often too selfish, insecure and unaware of what life truly means.
I realizes that on a huge scale, we are simply nothing, but little pieces of our universe.
Living, experiencing, finding out new things and discovering the universe's wonders.

After some time, I realized it's better to let it go and do what you want to do.
I used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely.
Nothing offends me, nothing hurts me, it's all pure intentions.

## Get away in charter spaceships

Sometimes I want to get the fuck out of here. To somewhere peaceful, where I don't have to feel shitty about myself.
Where I can just live, be one with the nature and mountains.

Getting away in spaceship means leaving my family, town, country. Sometimes it's too much.
I hate the way I live, the way we live.
I hate that I can't be myself. I hate I can't just love and feel comfortable loving people I've known my whole life.
Getting away seems easy, right?
It's running away that's easy, but the leaving that's hard.
Familiar feels safe, comfortable, but it might hurt you.
But is leaving right choice? I don't know.

## Right where I belong

Where do I belong? Who am I? It's the question that plays an existential role in my life.
Everything about my life, what I want to do, who I want to be.
Does it require too much effort to realize where I wanna be?
I think I've yet a lot of life ahead of me and I hope I will be okay.

All I wanted was just having my lovely family, brothers, sister and parents together.
Have my own family, my kids, and be happy.
To get where I belong, I gotta first figure shit out you know.

## Ring

Matter fact, I ain't asked no one for help, that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings.
I think my problem is that I don't ask for help. I always did everything myself, I learnt lots of shit myself,
I coped and didn't have anyone that would help me even a little bit.
It's like when someone says they want to help me, I can't seem to accept the help.
I'm shitty with asking for help, that's why I bottle up my emotions, deal with everything in silence, and push as hard as I can.
Sometimes I forget when I cried last time.

## All of the stars have a reason

I think every human have their own reason to be on Earth: to seek their dreams and be happy, shining for themselves.
Sometimes I can't apply it to myself. Can't seem to find the reason I'm this way.
But I think my ultimate goal is to make the world a better place, and love.

I really want to just love you know.

## They will scar and mock

I've been mocked and scared, I've sacrificed a lot to just get to here.
People said I'm shit, I thought I was shit.
Couldn't figure out why the fuck am I doint all of this.

The thing is life is hard sometimes, you would want to quit.
But I guess you just gotta be yourself, have faith and don't give a fuck.

## Taller in another dimension

I didn't have much intimacy and love. So I looked for it in a girl.
I fell in love with a girl last year. We knew everything about each other.
I knew her life, her problems, and I listened to her. I cared about her.
And I loved her more than myself, I would give up anything for her.
We hung out together after school, winter, evening.
We did our homeworks together, we prepared for exams together.
I thought I found my soulmate, the person I could spend my life together with.
I thought I would finally become happy.
I didn't realize that she didn't love me back though. And it hurt.
She chose other guys, who didn't care about her at all, treated her like shit.
I truly cared about her, I knew her problems, I wanted to protect her, help her.
But the problem was she didn't want to solve her problems.
She was ignorant, and didn't appreciate me.
We went from one of the closest people to strangers.
I hoped she would care about me. But she didn't.

We worked on a project together, I started to ignore her, we started to have conflicts.
It was rough talking to each other, because I got depressed because of shit I had with my family, school and other shit.
I felt like I slowly started to hate her, but still hoped that she would love me back.

We worked on a project and went to Aktau, and after pitching and getting results, we went to Caspian Sea.
For a while I thought about the sea, we was on a yacht and I was laying in the back of it.
I was so close to the sea, but didn't get to touch it.
I felt like it was a metaphor for no matter how close we was, I didn't get to be with her.
Eventually, I went to a pier and jumped from it. It was my first touch with the sea.
And I almost drowned in it, because I forgot how to swim.
I feel like that's the same thing that happened between us, if I got to be with her,
I would've probably destroy myself and become selfless.

And I destroyed myself for her, and is it healthy to love this much?

After that we went to the school, I got drunk drinking 3 bottles of Kymyz with alcohol,
I wrote her a letter about it, and next day I flew to Almaty.

## Fine Whine

For a while I've been depressed and sad about her, I always whined about it and cried about it like a bitch.
I couldn't let her go for a while, I thought I was going to die without her.
But it is a fine whine, sometimes it takes time to move on.
I did eventually move on, I realized my own mistakes, her mistakes, and now we don't talk.
I wish her the best tho. And I want her to know that.

If you read this, know that I cared about you so much, and I don't want you to be stressed out about it.
Just let it go. We will eventually grow apart. But I'm grateful I had you in my life.

## I'll pray for you, fuck the noise

Sometimes there's too much noise in your head. Life seems like it's going to fall apart.
And you think that you will not make it. When you're completely lonely, scared and depressed,
you think that you're not gonna make it and you will kill yourself.

After surviving all of that shit and getting back on your feet, you realize that you actually can make it.
Belive in yourself, ask for help and if you read this, know I pray for you.

## Resonance

Love and art is what truly resonates with me. I feel like music is what helped me not only cope, but grow as person.
Artists like Kendrick, J Cole, Kanye, Asap, Frank Ocean, Montell Fish and others are truly talented people.
Their music helped me to go through hard times, truly resonating with me, helping me to feel good.

## You're the light in the storm

Sometimes you gotta be the light in the storm. No matter how hard life seems, you gotta be optimisitic and have faith.
I thought I was gonna end up being an alcoholic, or depressed, or some other shit.
But I turned out to be a very loving person.
I wanted to break the generational trauma, and finally be the one who changes everything.
Changing internally, having good intentions, and being honest about yourself.

## Blue faces

Sometimes It's easy to be happy, but it's all about how you'll react to your surroundings.
I live in a very aggressive environement, I get mad a lot, and I can't control my emotions.
It triggers me, and I start to be anxious and sad. I feel like we need to be loving more.

## It's me vs me

Looking at other people, I thought I was unlucky and I'm going to be no one. But I realized it's me vs me.
I gotta be the better version of myself everyday. Just focus on myself and do better each day.

## If I can smoke fear away

Sometimes I try to smoke my fear away, and the "cigarette" is isolation. I zone out a lot,
and people ask me if I'm okay, and I simply reply with "yes", because It's hard to explain to people everything.
And I wish I could've just gave my little version a little bit a love. I'm very anxious most of the time,
I have to remind myself to breath sometimes. I've fear of being a dissapointment, or not fulfilling my life goals.
I don't want to end up regretting my life. Simply just want to live and love.

Sometimes I think, "Like, what the fuck was I thinking, like I was gonna be in a relatioship, I'm a fucking psycho
that's why I'm good at what I do", and I feel like sometimes it's true. I'm scared of love sometimes.

## Tears in your eyes

I think you shouldn't bottle up your emotions, you should feel your emotions.
Not just bottle them up, because eventually the bottled up emotions will turn into anger.
And most of the time I'm calm, but sometimes I want to just break everything and crash out.
Just get the fuck out of here, drop everything, and be myself.

## Feelings disperse

Sometimes you wait for feeling to disperse, you ignore them and act like you don't give a shit.
But you are a human, and you feel emotions, which mean you should feel them, instead of ignoring them and bottling them up.
Treating love like it's only a feeling is wrong. Because it's more than that.
And I think there's a visible contrast between treating it as a feeling and knowing what it truly is.


## Look in the mirror, I'm real

Sometimes I look in the mirror, and know I'm there, and proud to say I'm real.
I'm being honest with you, with everyone and myself.
Truly expressing my own feeling, not being scared of being open and honest.

If you don't know what you want to do in your life - it's okay.

If you don't know what to do with your shit - it's okay.

If you don't know where you're going to end up - it's okay.

Just be real, have good intentions and **LOVE**.

## But what love got to do with you when you don't love yourself

Learn to love yourself, because if you don't have respect for yourself, if you don't take care of yourself,
you will end up hurting yourself. Self-love is best love.

I'm still trying to learn to love myself.

## You love so much, you love when love hurts

I say what i wanna say, when i feel like it.

**I'm a paradox, I'm scared of love, I want love and I do love everyone**.

## Real
