## Server Actions

Let's say we have a page for deleting user with a button and a handler that calls the server action.

```tsx {2,5,8}
import { deleteUser } from "./action";
import { auth } from "./auth";

export default async function DeleteUserPage() {
  const { userId } = await auth();

  async function handleDelete() {
    await deleteUser(userId);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleDelete}>delete</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```ts
"use server";

// exporting the function and making it asynchronous turns it into a server action

export async function deleteUser(id: string) {
  await db.user.delete(id);
}
```

Now, what might seem to be a problem? The problem is that now anyone can delete any user.  

But How?

- The server action is a POST endpoint than can be accessed by anyone
- Anyone can call the server action and delete any user if they have their id

Solution

```ts
"use server";

export async function deleteUser(id: string) {
  await db.user.delete(id); // [!code --]

  const { userId } = await auth(); // [!code ++]

  if (userId !== id) { // [!code ++]
    throw new Error("Unauthorized") // [!code ++]
  } // [!code ++]

  await db.user.delete(id); // [!code ++]
}
```
