## nFactorial Incubator

In 2024 I was selected to **nFactorial Incubator**. It's one of the top Central Asian startup incubators **(2.5% acceptance rate)**.

During the 10 weeks in Almaty, I worked on my own startup.
I architected and developed an **AI-driven podcast generation platform** using Next.js and React, enabling users to create podcasts in English and Russian.
As a result, it reached more than **1000+ users** and **10+ active episodes** on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

And I was nominated for **Prodigy of The Year**.

## Demo Day

I was selected to Demo Day to present my startup in front of judges like **Arsen Tomsky, Founder of inDrive**, a ride-hailing service with 200 million downloads operating in more than 45 countries.

## Development

I can surely say that this project was one of my biggest achievements.
I used tools like Next.js, React, Redis, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, and AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT and **ElevenLabs** for realistic speech synthesis and voice cloning.

I orchestrated podcast, script, and audio generation workflows using message queues and CRON jobs with Qstash, ensuring efficient task execution and system scalability.

ElevenLabs really helped me to achieve **high-quality podcasts**, and I also managed to clone voices of Arman Suleimenov too!
